# https-dev

Adds self signed certificates to a https server to be used locally.

Extracted from [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server).

## Why

* Developing locally when integrating with third parties especially webhooks can require https
* Generating certificates is a pain
* Certificates clutter up the repository

## Usage

### Express

```js
const express = require('express');
const https = require('https');

const httpsDev = require('https-dev');

const ssl = httpsDev();

const app = express();

https.createServer(ssl, app).listen(3000);
```
